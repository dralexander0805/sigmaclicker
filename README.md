# Sigma Clicker Game

Sigma Clicker is a simple incremental game where you click to generate sigmas, a currency within the game. As you accumulate sigmas, you can purchase various generators and upgrades to increase your sigma production rate.

## How to Play
- **Generating Sigmas:** Click the "Create Sigma" button to manually generate sigmas.
- **Purchasing Generators:** Use your sigmas to purchase different types of generators like "Moggers" and "Skibidis" that automatically produce sigmas for you.
- **Unlocking New Features:** As you progress and accumulate more sigmas, new options like upgrades and additional generators become available.
- **Clearing Progress:** If you want to start over, you can clear your progress using the console command `clearProgress()`.

## Generators
- **Moggers:** Purchase moggers to automate sigma production. Each mogger increases sigma production by a certain amount per second.
- **Skibidis:** Skibidis generate more sigmas than moggers but are more expensive.
- **Unnamed Generator:** This generator unlocks once you reach a certain milestone and generates sigmas at a higher rate.

## Upgrades
- **Upgrade:** Purchase upgrades to boost the production rate of all your generators.

## Special Feature
- **Move to Ohio:** Once you accumulate a significant amount of sigmas, you have the option to move to Ohio, a special feature of the game.
